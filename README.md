## 🌟 Features

* **System Monitoring:** Collects CPU and Memory usage statistics by reading Linux's `/proc` filesystem via a non-blocking C daemon.
* **Daemonization:** Includes a standard UNIX daemonization routine (`fork`, `setsid`, redirect file descriptors to `/dev/null`).
* **Centralized Logging:** Persists system metrics and tagged messages to a single `./logs/monitor.log` file.
* **Web Dashboard:** A real-time web interface built with Flask and Chart.js to visualize CPU history, memory usage, and live log stream.
* **Log Analysis Utility:** A shell script (`analyze.sh`) for quick, command-line processing of the log file to count errors and warnings.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C compiler (GCC/Clang)
* GNU Make
* Python 3 (including `pip`)

### 1. Build the C Daemon

Navigate to the project root and use the `Makefile` to compile the `logmon` binary.

```bash
# In the project root directory
make
```
2. Install Python Dependencies
The web dashboard requires the Flask framework.

```bash

# Navigate to the web subdirectory
cd web

# Install Flask
pip install Flask

# Go back to the project root
cd ..
```
🏃 How to Run 

A. Run the C Daemon (Log Collector)
The daemon runs in the background and writes system metrics to ./logs/monitor.log every 2 seconds.

```bash

# Run the compiled binary (it will daemonize and detach)
./logmon
```
Note: To run in the foreground for debugging, use ./logmon --foreground or ./logmon -f.

B. Run the Web Dashboard
The Flask server reads the logs generated by the daemon and serves the web dashboard.

```bash

# Run the Flask application
python web/server.py
```
The server will start, typically at http://localhost:5000. Open this URL in your browser to view the live dashboard.

C. Analyze Logs with the Utility Script
Use the shell script to quickly check the log file for critical messages.

```bash

./scripts/analyze.sh logs/monitor.log
```
Example Output:
```bash
Analyzing file: logs/monitor.log...
